# Mars Rover Mission

A small program that allows you to guide a Mars Rover to explore the surface of planet Mars.
The project is a simple Vue.js App, and uses TailwindCSS as frontend framework.

## How to play?
Once you start the game, you will be presented the game board and some controls.
- In the board you will see your rover in green, and you can deduce its orientation using the white arrow on top, which always points to the front of the robot.
- Inside the input box, you can type the comands 'F', 'R' and 'L', standing for 'forward', 'right' and 'left', respectively, in any sequence up to ten characters at the time.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è If the Rover finds any obstacle, represented by the red tiles in the board, it will have to return to the starting point.

Have fun exploring the surface of the Red Planet! üî≠
